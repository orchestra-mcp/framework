user_story: "As a developer, I want an ActivationService that respects activationEvents from extension manifests (onStartup, onCommand, onView, etc.), so that extensions are only loaded when they are actually needed, improving startup performance."
points: 3
acceptance_criteria[7]: ActivationService registers extension manifests and their activationEvents,fireEvent() activates all extensions matching a given event string,fireStartupFinished() activates all eager (*) and onStartup extensions,"onCommand:, onLanguage:, onView:, onFileSystem:, onWebviewPanel: events are supported",Extensions are only activated once (duplicate fire is a no-op),markActivated/markDeactivated correctly track state,Unit tests cover all activation event types and edge cases
