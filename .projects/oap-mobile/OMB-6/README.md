# OMB-6: Shared Components & Theme

**Type**: Epic | **Status**: backlog | **Priority**: medium

Build the shared component library and design system: Markdown renderer (React Native version using same remark/rehype pipeline), chart components for dashboards and reports, common UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, lists, modals), theme system that maps IDE CSS variables to NativeWind theme tokens, and offline support infrastructure (local cache, action queue, reconnect sync, offline indicator).
