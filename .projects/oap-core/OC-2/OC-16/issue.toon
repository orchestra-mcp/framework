title: Build ExtensionHost (package discovery and loading)
status: done
created: 2026-02-09
user_story: "As a developer, I want an ExtensionHost that discovers packages from src/packages/*/package.json, loads their manifests, and activates them in dependency order with error isolation, so that extensions are loaded reliably and one failure does not crash others."
points: 8
acceptance_criteria[8]: ExtensionHost scans src/packages/ for package.json files,Manifests are validated using the extension scanner,Extensions are activated in dependency order (respecting extensionDependencies),One extension failing activation does not prevent others from activating,Activation has a configurable timeout (default 10s),Deactivation disposes all subscriptions cleanly,Global uncaught errors are traced back to source extension,"Unit tests cover discovery, loading, activation, deactivation, and error isolation"
