# OMB-56: Common UI Components Library

**Type**: Story | **Status**: backlog | **Points**: 8

As a developer, I want a library of reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, lists, modals, badges, avatars) with consistent Orchestra styling, so that all screens have a unified look and new screens can be built quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Button component with variants: primary, secondary, outline, destructive, ghost
- [ ] TextInput component with label, error, and helper text support
- [ ] Card component with optional header, body, and footer sections
- [ ] Badge component with color variants for statuses and priorities
- [ ] Avatar component with image support and initials fallback
- [ ] Modal/BottomSheet component for action sheets and pickers
- [ ] StatusDot component for online/offline/status indicators
- [ ] All components use NativeWind className and accept className override prop
- [ ] Components exported from src/mobile/src/components/common/index.ts
