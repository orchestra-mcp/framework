# OMB-5: Real-time & Push Notifications

**Type**: Epic | **Status**: backlog | **Priority**: high

Implement the real-time communication layer: Socket.io WebSocket connection to the cloud platform for live updates (task changes, timer events, agent status, team activity), Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications for both iOS and Android (agent permissions, agent questions, task assigned, meeting reminders), and background notification handling with deep link navigation to relevant screens.
