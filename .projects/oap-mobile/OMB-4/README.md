# OMB-4: Team Owner Features

**Type**: Epic | **Status**: backlog | **Priority**: medium

Build team owner screens: team activity dashboard showing member list with real-time online/offline status and current activity, team progress widgets, and team management features (invite members, assign roles, view member profiles). These screens are accessible only to users with team_owner role and consume team-specific API endpoints.
