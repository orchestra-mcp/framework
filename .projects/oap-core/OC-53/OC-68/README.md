# OC-68: Create FirebaseService with cross-platform support

**Type**: Story | **Status**: backlog | **Points**: 8

As a developer, I want a unified Firebase service that works across Electron, Web, Chrome, and Mobile so that I can track analytics and performance consistently

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Service initializes Firebase with config from .env
- [ ] Analytics tracking works on web/electron platforms
- [ ] Performance monitoring integrated
- [ ] Error tracking implemented
- [ ] Platform detection works correctly
- [ ] Service degrades gracefully if Firebase unavailable
