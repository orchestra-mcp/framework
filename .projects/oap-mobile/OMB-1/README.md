# OMB-1: React Native Project Setup

**Type**: Epic | **Status**: backlog | **Priority**: high

Scaffold the React Native 0.76+ project at src/mobile/ with all foundational dependencies: NativeWind 4 (Tailwind CSS for RN), React Navigation 7, Zustand state management, Socket.io client, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), and strict TypeScript 5.9 configuration. This epic establishes the project skeleton, build tooling, and folder structure that all subsequent epics depend on.
