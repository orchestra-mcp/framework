# OCD-32: Marketplace Control & Feature Flags

**Type**: Story | **Status**: backlog | **Points**: 5

As an admin, I want to approve/reject marketplace submissions and manage feature flags so that I control what extensions are available and what features are enabled.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Approve/reject submitted extensions
- [ ] Feature/unfeature extensions
- [ ] Manage extension categories
- [ ] Download/install analytics per extension
- [ ] Feature flag toggle (system-wide)
- [ ] Per-plan feature gating (free vs pro)
- [ ] Feature flag list with search
