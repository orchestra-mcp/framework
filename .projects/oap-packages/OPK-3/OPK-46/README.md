# OPK-46: Migrate Tasks Manager main services

**Type**: Story | **Status**: backlog | **Points**: 5

As a developer, I want the task management service logic migrated from extensions/tasks/ into the Tasks Manager package so that task functionality is self-contained.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tasksRpcHandlers.ts migrated to src/Services/
- [ ] timeTrackingReader.ts migrated to src/Services/
- [ ] MCP tools for task operations defined
- [ ] All imports updated
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
