# OCD-12: Base Layouts, Routing & Testing Setup

**Type**: Story | **Status**: backlog | **Points**: 5

As a developer, I want base Inertia layouts, route structure, and testing infrastructure in place so that all subsequent features have a consistent foundation to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] App layout with navigation created as React component
- [ ] Guest layout for public pages created
- [ ] Dashboard layout for authenticated pages created
- [ ] Route files organized (web.php, api.php, channels.php)
- [ ] Vitest or PHPUnit configured and a sample test passes
- [ ] Middleware groups configured (auth, guest, admin, team-owner)
