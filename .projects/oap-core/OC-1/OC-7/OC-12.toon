description: "**Command to run:** `pnpm dev:desktop`\n\n**What to do:**\n1. Run `pnpm dev:desktop` from the project root\n2. Verify the Electron tray app starts without crashing\n3. Check the console output for any errors related to:\n   - Missing modules or unresolved imports\n   - Path resolution failures (e.g., cannot find `src/app/...` or `src/packages/...`)\n   - electron-vite compilation errors\n4. If errors occur, trace them back to the config files modified in OC-8, OC-9, OC-10, OC-11 and fix\n\n**Common issues to watch for:**\n- `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors: usually means a path alias is wrong in tsconfig or vite config\n- `Cannot find module '@app/...'`: means the Vite alias or tsconfig paths are misconfigured\n- Build errors in the terminal: check that `electron.vite.config.ts` entry points resolve\n\n**Verification:** The tray app appears in the macOS menu bar. No errors in the terminal output."
