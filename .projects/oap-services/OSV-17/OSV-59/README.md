# OSV-59: TextMate Service, Semantic Tokens & Documentation

**Type**: Story | **Status**: backlog | **Points**: 5

As a developer, I want TextMate grammar loading and semantic token registry so that the editor can provide syntax highlighting from VSCode grammars, plus documentation for the compatibility layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] TextMate grammar registry loads .tmLanguage grammars
- [ ] Semantic token types and modifiers registry
- [ ] Grammar-to-language mapping from VSCode extension manifests
- [ ] Integration with ThemeService for token color resolution
- [ ] docs/core-services/vscode-compatibility.md with compatibility matrix and limitations
