# OMB-3: Employee Dashboard

**Type**: Epic | **Status**: backlog | **Priority**: high

Build the core employee experience: dashboard with progress widgets, full task management (project->epic->story->task hierarchy with markdown), timer/break/pomodoro controls with reports, version control overview (commits, PRs, issues), AI agent control panel (status, permissions, prompts), and notification center. All screens consume REST APIs from the cloud platform and receive real-time updates via WebSocket.
