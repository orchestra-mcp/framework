title: Refactor index.tsx bootstrap to use extension registration system
status: backlog
created: 2026-02-09
user_story: "As the system architect, I want the sidepanel index.tsx entry point to bootstrap extensions via a registration system instead of calling individual init functions, so that adding new extensions is declarative and does not require editing the entry point."
points: 5
acceptance_criteria[7]: index.tsx at packages/chrome-extension/src/sidepanel/index.tsx reduced to ~30 lines,index.tsx calls installWindowOrchestra() from new transport location,index.tsx calls a single initExtensions() or loadExtensions() that auto-discovers and registers all extension contributions,"No direct calls to initGitStore, initRemoteStore, initMultiRepoStore, etc.",Each extension package exports a registerChromeContributions() function,Extension registration order does not matter (all registrations are additive),Chrome extension boots successfully and all sidepanel features work
