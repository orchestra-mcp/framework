user_story: "As an extension developer, I want an abstract ServiceProvider base class with register/boot/shutdown methods and access to the DI container, so that every extension follows a consistent lifecycle pattern and can register services in a standard way."
points: 3
acceptance_criteria[7]: "Abstract ServiceProvider class exists with register(), boot(), shutdown() methods",ServiceProvider has access to the ServiceRegistry (DI container) via constructor injection,register() is called first to register services into the container,boot() is called after all providers have registered,shutdown() is called during extension deactivation for cleanup,TypeScript generics allow typed service resolution,Unit tests verify the lifecycle call order
